# JG_rasp-1
This is a work in progress.
A controll interface for an RGB LED matrix running on a RaspberryPi.
This framework allows for image processing, audio processing, and wireless control.
The interface allows for modular additions. 
The project is finished, I just need to push everything from the pi to github!
